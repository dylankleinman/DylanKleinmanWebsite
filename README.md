# Website of Dylan Kleinman
Based off a bootstrap template, this website is a home for my projects, art, and other interests.  Built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery with multiple pages and plugins. 

Not currently considered a live site, but is on github pages: https://dylankleinman.github.io/DylanKleinmanWebsite/
